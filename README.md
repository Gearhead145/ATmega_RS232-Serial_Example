This example was creates the basics to emulate rs232 communications

The authors intention with the next repo is to implement the
knowledge acquired here for communicating with a Morningstar Sunsaver MPPT

Flow Control using RTS and CTS are not implemented but can be added easily

Settings for this device are: 

9600 baud
8 databits
two stop bits
no parity bit
